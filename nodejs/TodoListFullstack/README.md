* MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.
* Responsive design built with React.js.
* Authentication and authorization features (if applicable).

## Technologies Used
* Frontend: React.js, CSS, Tailwind CSS (if used).
* Backend: Node.js, Express.js.
* Database: MongoDB.
* Others: Axios (or Fetch API) for API requests, dotenv for environment variables.
